# Onjabook : Facebook clone

## Statement

### Weâ€™re going to build a Facebook clone called OnjaBook.

It will contain 3 pages : Feed, Add a post, options.

Feed page: Itâ€™s where I see a few posts. I can like a post, and post a comment on it.

Add a post: Itâ€™s a simple form page where I can create a new post!

Options : Itâ€™s a page where I can update a simple profile.

Tech requirements :

- There should be a global context state, handled with a reducer
- The post components needs to be a Compound Component
Feel free to update the styles as you want, but focus on the functional requirements first.

Send me the github link and netlify link when itâ€™s done.

Happy coding!
